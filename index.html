          My entire life, I thought my career would be in Human Resources.
          Ironically, working in Human Resources, is when my love for software
          really sparked! I've always loved dabbling with coding, playing around
          changing codes and adding my own twist, but it was only when I started
          using software where I could remotely access so much more than what
          the eye could see, is when I realized, wow, playing with someone
          else's programs is fun, but I want to know what took to get here! I
          currently work for Walgreens troubleshooting software and hardware,
          and had me thinking, why stop there?
